# Solide State 1 Lab Report
 This is My report on "The features of semiconductor solar batteries" Experiment

 This repository contains my report for the solid-state1 lab
 Spring of 2023(Farvardin 1402 Shamsi).
 
This report utilized LaTeX to generate the experiment results, while Python programming language was employed to calculate and interpret the recorded laboratory data. The investigation aimed to determine if there exists a linear regression relationship among the results. To conduct this analysis, the following Python libraries were utilized: Matplotlib.Pyplot, seaborn, pandas, Numpy, and Scipy.
